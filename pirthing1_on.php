# A simple, non-conditional script for PIRThing (https://github.com/kenkl/pirthing). PIRThing, based on
# MotionNightlight (https://github.com/kenkl/MotionNightlight), is an ESP8266 that has a PIR sensor and will call an on or
# off script here based on its logic/timings. Which unit(s) it affects are then expressed here, letting PIRThing control
# different lights with different behaviours without reflashing PIRThing itself.
